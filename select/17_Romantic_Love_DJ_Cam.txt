G Love And Special Sauce
I Love You
I guess I'm lucky
It's in my blood I've got you and us two
That's what I'm thinking of
So you're moving into my place
That's a 24 hour taste
That's no can that's a case
This feeling I sure can't sense

I know it sounds old
But I love you I love you
I love you

So we seem a little young we have fun
We're friends we've lovers
Who cares about those others
Already got fathers and mothers
Two can be a crew got plenty to do something to see
Look in my eyes baby
Believe me

I know it sounds old
But I love you I love you
I love you

Your pops don't like me
Your moms sure does
She's seen the looks I give you
Seen them enough
To know this ain't no phase
Or some part time craze
It's a love affair that lasts during the week days

I believe in lucky and money
I've got ten bucks and a honey
I know I'm lucky
Just look at you and me
Move on in move on in
That ain't no sin
It ain't gonna be a sin
When we turn the lights to dim

I know it sounds old
But I love you I love you
I love you
