How fucking romantic
All the stars are out
Twinkling twinkling twinkling
And fluttering about
What a tacky sunset
What a vulgar moon
Play another charming
Rogers and Hart tune
How fucking romantic
Must we really waltz?
Drag another cliche
Howling from the vaults
Love you obviously
Like you really care
Even though you treat me
Like a dancing bear
Toss your bear a goldfish
As he cycles by
Don't forget to feed your
Bear or it'll die
